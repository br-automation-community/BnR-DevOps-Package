# BnR-DevOps-Package
The B&R DevOps Package is a consolidation of materials that defines DevOps, explains the key benefits, and provides insights on how to incorporate DevOps practices into Automation Studio project development. 

The goal of this package is to significantly reduce the barriers to entry of DevOps strategies into the day-to-day workflow of Automation Studio project development, in order to increase the efficiency, quality, and maintainability of the resulting applications.
